Initializeing

git init



Staging Process:
1) Adding     git add <file_name> or git add .
2) Saving/Commiting   git commit -m "commit message"


Git Server
To put the staged files to Git Server
git push <repo_url> <branch_name>    

eg: git push origin master  --> but to use origin we must have first tell the system that origin is nothing but repo_url so we use
git remote add origin <repo_url>

In case it says origin is already initalized we can use any other name, it is just like a variable. 
eg: git remote add shortcut1  <repo_url>   --> So i have initialzed my repo url to new variable called shortcut1
so i can now give for pushing: git push shortcut1 <branch_name>



How to add new branch

1) git branch <new_branch_name>

2) To see all the branches
git branch

3) To go to any branch we can use
git checkout <branchname_we wish to be in or go to>
